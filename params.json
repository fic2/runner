Powered by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Panamax](http://panamax.io/).\r\n\r\nGet started:\r\n* [Launch VM in FIWARE Lab](https://195.220.224.10/#!/create) ([FIWARE community account required](https://account.lab.fiware.org/) required)\r\n* [Launch VM in Amazon EC2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks/new?stackName=FIC2Lab&templateURL=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fic2lab/panamax-cloudformation-ireland-nokey.json) ([AWS account](http://aws.amazon.com/) required)\r\n* Many other options\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nMany of the FI-CONTENT 2 Specific Enablers are server-side open-source software that you can easily reuse to build your own applications. For simplicity, these enablers have been packaged as Docker images that are publicly available. You can run them in your own machine or in the cloud.\r\n\r\n### What is Docker?\r\n\r\nDocker is an open-source project for shipping and running applications inside lightweight software containers that can run anywhere. Any application that runs on Linux can be packaged as a Docker container.\r\n\r\nDocker is very popular, and there are more than 70,000 Dockerized applications at the DockerHub Registry: [*https://registry.hub.docker.com/*](https://registry.hub.docker.com/)\r\n\r\n### How can I use the Docker images of the Specific Enablers?\r\n\r\nYou can deploy and manage our Docker images in different ways:\r\n\r\n-   using command-line tools in their own machine\r\n\r\n-   using command-line tools in a remote machine in the Cloud (any provider, including FIWARE Lab Cloud)\r\n\r\n-   using the FIC2Lab runner web-based tool to manage an instance on FIWARE Lab Cloud (best for beginners, limited for advanced users)\r\n\r\nOur Specific Enablers are available as public Docker images:\r\n\r\n[*https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/fic2/*](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/fic2/)\r\n\r\n![](images/image1.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"_Toc419306975\" class=\"anchor\"></span>Figure 4 - The FI-CONTENT 2 public repository of Docker images\r\n\r\nThe following subsections will show the different ways in which you can run SEs.\r\n\r\nRun SEs using the FIC2Lab runner web-based tool (on top of FIWARE Lab Cloud)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFIC2Lab runner is a tool that automatically sets up for you a running VM instance with a Docker host and a web UI on top of the FIWARE Lab Cloud infrastructure. You don't need to know anything about the FIWARE Lab Cloud, it will configure all the infrastructure, network, security, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, you will need to have a FIWARE Lab account and request a community upgrade in the Lannion region. The community upgrade grants you the right to allocate a public IP address within the cloud.\r\n\r\nYou can request your account and the community upgrade at [*https://account.lab.fiware.org*](https://account.lab.fiware.org)\r\n\r\n![](images/image2.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"_Toc419306976\" class=\"anchor\"></span>Figure 5 - FIWARE Lab portal to sign up and request community upgrade\r\n\r\nOnce you have received a confirmation of your upgrade to a community account, you can go to the FIC2Lab runner wizard at [*https://runner.developer.mediafi.org*](https://runner.developer.mediafi.org) where you will be guided through the steps to create your own run environment.\r\n\r\n![](images/image3.png)\r\n\r\n![](images/image4.png)\r\n\r\n![](images/image5.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"_Toc419306977\" class=\"anchor\"></span>Figure 6 - FIC2Lab runner (beta) - Landing page\r\n\r\nOnce you click on the button to start creating your environment, the wizard will go through a number of steps that set up everything that you need on FIWARE Lab Cloud. If everything goes right, you should see a pop-up with the URL to your dedicated management console.\r\n\r\n![](images/image6.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"_Toc419306978\" class=\"anchor\"></span>Figure 7 - FIC2Lab runner (beta) - Deployment wizard\r\n\r\nSome of the things that can go wrong are:\r\n\r\n-   You are not logged in with your FIWARE Lab account.\r\n\r\n-   You don’t have a community account in the selected region.\r\n\r\n-   Your quota of public IP addresses or VM instances is full.\r\n\r\n-   There is an issue in the selected region. Try again in a few minutes or file a ticket.\r\n\r\nOnce you go to your dedicated Panamax management console, you will be able to deploy and manage applications that will be publicly available online, listening on different ports of your public IP address.\r\n\r\nThere’s 2 types of artifacts that can be deployed:\r\n\r\n-   **Images**: individual Docker images. When deployed, they are called **services**.\r\n\r\n-   **Application Templates**: linked sets of Docker images. When deployed, they are called **applications**, composed of one or more **services**.\r\n\r\nThe user interface provides a built-in search capability that can search any public Docker image repository through Docker Hub, including the FI-CONTENT 2 repository. It will search as well public Application Templates from Panamax.io. You can also select from the list the featured templates and images.\r\n\r\n![](images/image7.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"_Toc419306979\" class=\"anchor\"></span>Figure 8 - FIC2Lab runner (beta) - User-dedicated management console\r\n\r\nLet’s select the Social Network SE and click on “Run Template”. This will trigger under the hood the download and launch of an application with one image: “fic2/ppnet”. It will open the management dashboard for this application and show a spinning wheel that means that the deployment is taking place.\r\n\r\n![](images/image8.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"_Toc419306980\" class=\"anchor\"></span>Figure 9 - FIC2Lab runner (beta) - Social Network Enabler SE launched from the console\r\n\r\nCategories help you structure your application in tiers. If you are creating a multi-tiered application using multiple Docker images, you can add more images to your application here.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the screen, the application activity log shows the detailed status of your application (the CoreOS Journal).\r\n\r\nYou can manage the settings of the services within your application. Let’s click on the only service deployed in this application: ppnet. From this page you can:\r\n\r\n-   Bind ports\r\n\r\n-   Link services\r\n\r\n-   Set environment variables\r\n\r\n-   Mount host volumes\r\n\r\n-   Pass arguments to the services entry point\r\n\r\nFor convenience, all the exposed ports of a Docker image are bound to the outside in a randomly generated port (in the 49000-50000 range). You can change that in the “Ports” tab of the service configuration, as shown below.\r\n\r\n![](images/image9.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"_Toc419306981\" class=\"anchor\"></span>Figure 10 - FIC2Lab runner (beta) - Changing port mapping of the SNE SE instance\r\n\r\nRun SEs using command-line tools in your own machine\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOur software is packaged as standard Docker images. You can easily launch them from a terminal in your own machine.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with Docker, you can find the Docker images and the instructions in the FIC2Lab DockerHub repository: [*https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/fic2/*](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/fic2/)\r\n\r\n### Installing Docker\r\n\r\nDocker runs natively on any recent Linux. It can be used in Windows and Mac OS X using boot2docker, which installs VirtualBox with a guest Linux for you.\r\n\r\nTo get it running on your machine, follow the Docker installation instructions: [*http://docs.docker.com/installation/*](http://docs.docker.com/installation/).\r\n\r\nUnder Mac OS X, you can use Kitematic, a nice user interface (also installs VirtualBox with a guest Linux): [*http://kitematic.com*](http://kitematic.com)\r\n\r\nYou can also deploy it to different Cloud providers easily using Docker Machine: [*https://docs.docker.com/machine/*](https://docs.docker.com/machine/)\r\n\r\n### Running a SE from the command line\r\n\r\nWe assume you have installed Docker on a Linux machine, or using boot2docker on a Windows or Mac.\r\n\r\nFind your SE on the public FI-CONTENT 2 repository [*https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/fic2/*](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/fic2/)\r\n\r\nThen follow the instructions there. For instance, here are the instructions to run the Social Network SE:\r\n\r\n![](images/image10.png)\r\n\r\nThis will download the Docker image for ppnet, run it in a Docker container and forward the container port 80 to the host port 8000:\r\n\r\ndocker run -d -p 8000:80 fic2/ppnet\r\n\r\nUnable to find image 'fic2/ppnet:latest' locally Pulling repository fic2/ppnet\r\n\r\nb454781957ed: Download complete\r\n\r\n511136ea3c5a: Download complete\r\n\r\na5b60fe97da5: Download complete\r\n\r\n390a00bdb439: Download complete\r\n\r\naf7c9ae40363: Download complete\r\n\r\n84cde1578c13: Download complete\r\n\r\nd81ff9276ee7: Download complete\r\n\r\n9520277322c9: Download complete\r\n\r\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for fic2/ppnet:latest\r\n\r\na12d72b85f092c288d30ae6d0562e9861de8625e60aa985ff186ec075f929da7\r\n\r\nOnce the download is complete, the container will be up and running and we will get a container ID in the console. To check all the running containers, type:\r\n\r\n\\$ docker ps\r\n\r\nCONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED\r\n\r\nSTATUS PORTS NAMES\r\n\r\na12d72b85f09 fic2/ppnet:latest \"/usr/local/bin/run. 44\r\n\r\nseconds ago Up 43 seconds 0.0.0.0:8000-\\>80/tcp\r\n\r\nmad\\_goldstine\r\n\r\nYou will notice the port redirection from host machine (0.0.0.0) port 8000 to container port 80. A random name will be generated if none is specified.\r\n\r\nRun SEs using command-line tools in a remote machine in the cloud\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDocker Inc. develops a tool called docker-machine that you can use to automatically set up a docker host machine somewhere, and it can target cloud providers, including FIWARE Lab.\r\n\r\nYou will need to allocate at 1 virtual machine instance with 1 public IP address. We will assume you have a Community account with enough free quotas in a FIWARE Lab region, for instance Lannion2.\r\n\r\n### Preparing the cloud environment\r\n\r\nThere is one step that needs to be done manually in the FIWARE Lab Cloud Portal: the creation of a security group to allow inbound connections to the instance. You can name it, e.g. “docker-machine-sg” and you must open the following incoming TCP ports:\r\n\r\n-   22: docker-machine will create its own keypair and SSH to port 22 to connect to the instance\r\n\r\n-   2376: the docker client in your local machine will be configured to connect to the remote docker daemon in the instance that listens on port 2376\r\n\r\n-   32768-33768: when launching docker containers using docker run -P (note the capital P), docker will randomly expose the service on a port starting from 32768 and increased for each new service.\r\n\r\n![](images/image11.png)\r\n\r\n<span id=\"_Toc419306985\" class=\"anchor\"></span>Figure 14 - Configuring the security group rules for docker-machine\r\n\r\nYou will also need to retrieve the following information:\r\n\r\n-   username: the e-mail address you use to login in FIWARE Lab\r\n\r\n-   password: your FIWARE Lab password\r\n\r\n-   tenant ID: upon connecting to the Cloud Portal, retrieve the ID at the bottom of the screen in the message “Connected to project your-name cloud (ID 00000000000000000000000000001234)”\r\n\r\n-   region: the region where your Community account has the right to allocate instances and public IPs, e.g. Lannion2\r\n\r\n### Setting up the tools\r\n\r\n1.  Install Docker Machine following the instructions: [*https://docs.docker.com/machine/\\#installation*](https://docs.docker.com/machine/#installation)\r\n\r\n2.  Load the environment variables to target the FIWARE Lab node, e.g.:\r\n\r\nexport OS\\_REGION\\_NAME=Lannion2\r\n\r\nexport OS\\_TENANT\\_ID=00000000000000000000000000001234\r\n\r\nexport OS\\_USERNAME=emailaddress\r\n\r\nexport OS\\_PASSWORD=password\r\n\r\nexport OS\\_AUTH\\_URL=http://cloud.lab.fi-ware.org:4730/v2.0/\r\n\r\nexport OS\\_AUTH\\_STRATEGY=keystone\r\n\r\nDocker-machine will use these environment variables to connect to OpenStack.\r\n\r\n### Creating and managing the remote Docker host on FIWARE Lab\r\n\r\nThe following command will use your credentials to create a small instance with an Ubuntu 14.04 image connected to the specified network, using the previously created security group docker-machine-sg and associating a public IP address from the specified pool. These parameters were tested in Lannion2 region, you need to change them for other regions.\r\n\r\n\\$ docker-machine create \\\\\r\n\r\n-d openstack \\\\\r\n\r\n--openstack-flavor-id=\"2\" \\\\\r\n\r\n--openstack-image-id=\"7be3296f-dcc4-494f-ba97-dd572475024c\" \\\\\r\n\r\n--openstack-net-name=\"node-int-net-01\" \\\\\r\n\r\n--openstack-floatingip-pool=\"public-ext-net-01\" \\\\\r\n\r\n--openstack-sec-groups=\"docker-machine-sg\" my-host\r\n\r\nCreating machine...\r\n\r\nTo see how to connect Docker to this machine, run:\r\n\r\ndocker-machine env my-host\r\n\r\nThe instance is up and running.
